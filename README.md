# Workshop Auto Translation Using AI LLM Models

## Overview

This repository contains code for automating the translation of Nuevo Foundation's workshops from its workshop website using AI Large Language Models (LLM). The code leverages OpenAI's powerful language models to perform translation tasks, making the process more efficient and accurate. It was developed during Hacakthon 2023 on Microsoft's Redmond campus.

## What it Does

The code in this repository enables the translation of workshop content from one language to another using OpenAI's Language Models. Specifically, it does the following:

1. Iterates through a specified folder containing workshop content files.

2. Reads the content of each file.

3. Utilizes OpenAI's Language Models to translate the content into the desired target language.

4. Saves the translated content as separate files, preserving the original file structure.

## Benefits

### 1. Efficiency

Manual translation of workshop content can be time-consuming and error-prone. This code automates the translation process, allowing for the quick and consistent translation of a large volume of content.

### 2. Accuracy

OpenAI's Language Models are designed to produce high-quality translations, ensuring that the translated workshop content maintains its clarity and meaning.

### 3. Scalability

As Nuevo Foundation's workshop content continues to grow, this code can be easily scaled to handle a larger number of workshops and languages.

### 4. Preservation of Original Content

The code preserves the original content structure by saving translated files separately. This ensures that the translated content can be easily referenced alongside the original content.

## Positive Impact

By automating the translation of Nuevo Foundation's workshops, this code contributes to making educational resources more accessible to a global audience. It enables learners and educators from different language backgrounds to access and benefit from the foundation's valuable workshops, ultimately promoting knowledge sharing and inclusivity.

We believe that technology can play a vital role in breaking language barriers and expanding educational opportunities. This code represents a step towards that goal by harnessing the power of AI language models for social good.

We welcome contributions and collaboration to further improve and expand the capabilities of this translation tool for the benefit of education and knowledge dissemination.
